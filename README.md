## Interaction Sequence 1

For Interaction Sequence 1, you will explore how to create an account on Aspiration, select a charity, and set up your round-up donations.

To open Aspiration, click on the lovable link above.

First, please make an account using the "Get Started" button.  The statistics on the right of the login page are placeholders.  Remember your account details if you would like to return to the application.

Second, select the charity for which you would be interested in contributing donations to.  If you want to learn more, select each charity and read their descriptions.

DO NOT ENTER YOUR REAL CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

Again, third, enter FAKE credit card information for testing purposes that we would usually use when making round up donations at your next purchases. Database is not yet secure so please do NOT enter real credit card information for testing.  The option to change your credit card information along with a secure database will be implemented at a future time.

Finally, you can view your dashboard and, by clicking on your profile, adjust any of the above that you have set up on your account.

## Interaction Sequence 2

For Interaction Sequence 2, you will explore how the Aspiration chrome extension works on Amazon.  

First, you will go on amazon as you normally would, and select a product that you would like to purchase.

Second, navigate to checkout and wait for a pop-up from Aspiration which confirms a donation.

Third, navigate to your profile through the extension, and check that your donation history was updated.
